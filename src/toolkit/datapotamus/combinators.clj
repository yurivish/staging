  "The primitive token-algebra combinators — `fan-out` and `fan-in`.

   composes from `step` + the message helpers; those recipes live in
   datapotamus.md, not here.

   A fan-out's id doubles as its group name. Downstream `fan-in`

   3-arity — dynamic: `selector-fn` is called on each input's data and

     • a vector/seq of port keywords — broadcast input payload to those
       ports (a subset of `ports`), or
     • a map {port-kw payload} — distinct payloads per port.
   The selector may only pick among `ports`, which is declared at

(defn fan-in
  "Accumulate inputs whose tokens carry a group minted by the fan-out
   named `fan-out-id`. When a group's XOR sum reaches 0, emit one
   `msg/merge` whose parents are all the collected messages and whose
   data is a `{port data}` map — keyed by the input port each sibling
   arrived on. Declare one input port per corresponding fan-out output
   port so arrival port-of-origin is structurally preserved (mirrors
   Go's FanIn). If a port receives multiple siblings the value under
   that port key becomes a vector; single-arrival ports stay scalar.

   Optional `post-fn` runs on the `{port data}` map before emission —
   use `vals` to drop port keys, or any custom combine. Defaults to
   `identity`.

   State is keyed on the per-invocation gid `[fan-out-id parent-msg-id]`
   so multiple groups can be in flight simultaneously. While
   accumulating (no group closed this invocation) returns `msg/drain`
   to suppress the default auto-signal; the stashed parent refs carry
   tokens forward via the eventual merge."

   segment below that. Backpressure arrives via channel buffers — a slow
